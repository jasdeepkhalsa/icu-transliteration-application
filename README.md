# ICU Transliteration Application
##Introduction
The ICU Transliteration Application, originally developed for The Sikher Project (http://www.sikher.com), is a Java application that can transliterate large amounts of Unicode text rapidly through the ICU API (http://site.icu-project.org/). Transliteration can be done between 33 major Unicode scripts including Latin, Arabic, Armenian, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Gurmukhi and Hebrew.
